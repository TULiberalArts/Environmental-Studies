## Resources are here to help!

## Study Abroad

We encourage students to study abroad for one semester, which can be a critical part of undergraduate education either through a Temple or other accredited university program. Study abroad is the fastest way to learn a second (or third) language and it can open the door to future international work. To visit the study abroad office website, please follow the link [here](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/).

## Internships

We encourage students to incorporate an internship into their plan of study. We have relationships with local employers and students can receive academic credit for completed internships. To see a list of organizations where our students have interned, please follow the link [here](http://www.cla.temple.edu/gus/undergraduate/list-of-recent-internships/).
