## Professional Organizations

**Association of American Geographers**
Our MA and PhD programs are affiliated with the [Association of American Geographers](http://www.aag.org/) (AAG), a non-profit scientific and educational society aimed at advancing the understanding, study and importance of geography and related fields. The Annals of the Association of American Geographers and The _Professional Geographer_ are the association's flagship journals and the organization holds an annual meeting. In 2015, the organization awarded Temple University Press the [AAG Publication Award](https://news.temple.edu/news/2015-12-08/awards-temple-university-press), given in recognition of exceptional and outstanding contributions to the discipline by publishers.

**Urban Affairs Association**
In addition to the Association of American Geographers, our MA and PhD programs in Geography and Urban Studies are affiliated with the [Urban Affairs Association](http://urbanaffairsassociation.org/) (UAA). The Urban Affairs Association is dedicated to creating interdisciplinary spaces for engaging in intellectual and practical discussions about urban life.
