## Study Abroad

We encourage environmental studies students to [study abroad](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/) for one semester, which can be a critical part of undergraduate education either through a Temple or other accredited university program. Study abroad is the fastest way to learn a second (or third) language and it can open the door to future international work.

## Internships

We encourage students to incorporate an internship into their plan of study. We have relationships with local employers and students can receive academic credit for completed internships.

For more information about environmental studies internships, visit the [geography and urban studies department](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/geography-and-urban-studies/resources/#internships) website.
