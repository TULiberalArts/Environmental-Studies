## Student Organizations

**Gamma Theta Upsilon**
Membership in the Honorary Society in Geography is available to majors selected on the basis of GPA. Initiations are held each year and student members can submit articles to the GYU journal and apply for scholarships.

**Majors’ Association**
The Geography and Urban Studies and Environmental Undergraduate Student Association is designed to create a space for students in both majors to meet and discuss topics of interest, go on trips around Philadelphia and host events for their fellow students. Members of either major or minor as well as any students from any department with related interests are welcome to join.

The Temple University Graduate Students Association (TUGSA) is the first and only recognized graduate student employee union in the state of Pennsylvania. In affiliation with the American Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO, we work to effect real changes in our jobs, lives and university.

## Professional Organizations

**Association of American Geographers**
Our MA and PhD programs are affiliated with the [Association of American Geographers](http://www.aag.org/) (AAG), a non-profit scientific and educational society aimed at advancing the understanding, study and importance of geography and related fields. The Annals of the Association of American Geographers and The _Professional Geographer_ are the association's flagship journals and the organization holds an annual meeting. In 2015, the organization awarded Temple University Press the [AAG Publication Award](https://news.temple.edu/news/2015-12-08/awards-temple-university-press), given in recognition of exceptional and outstanding contributions to the discipline by publishers.

**Urban Affairs Association**
In addition to the Association of American Geographers, our MA and PhD programs in Geography and Urban Studies are affiliated with the [Urban Affairs Association](http://urbanaffairsassociation.org/) (UAA).
