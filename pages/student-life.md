Earning your environmental studies degree is about more than what you learn in the classroom. Consider [studying abroad](#study-abroad), applying for [awards or scholarships](#environmental-studies-awards-and-scholarships), join an [undergraduate student organization](#student-organizations-for-environmental-studies-students) or our [graduate professional organization](#graduate-professional-organizations-for-environmental-studies).

## Study Abroad
Students are encouraged to study abroad during their undergraduate career for at least one semester through either Temple University or another accredited university program. Studying abroad is the fastest way to learn a second (or third) language–a critical part of undergraduate education–and it can open the door to future international work. We work closely with students to help identify study abroad programs and courses that keep them on track for graduation.

## Graduate Professional Organizations for Environmental Studies
**Association of American Geographers**
Our MA and PhD programs are affiliated with the [Association of American Geographers](http://www.aag.org/) (AAG), a non-profit scientific and educational society aimed at advancing the understanding, study and importance of geography and related fields. The Annals of the Association of American Geographers and The _Professional Geographer_ are the association's flagship journals and the organization holds an annual meeting. In 2015, the organization awarded Temple University Press the [AAG Publication Award](https://news.temple.edu/news/2015-12-08/awards-temple-university-press), given in recognition of exceptional and outstanding contributions to the discipline by publishers.
