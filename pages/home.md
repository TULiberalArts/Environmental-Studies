The Environmental Studies program examines the nature, causes and consequences of human  interactions with the environment. Our curriculum is focused around the themes of globalization, sustainability, social justice and geographic methods.

We equip our students with the tools to understand and address the crucial environmental issues of our time, such as climate change, food access and natural resource consumption. Through interdisciplinary coursework that confers strong  social science skills with technical training, our students are trained to analyze multi-faceted  problems with a range of analytical tools and  skills, including:

   - A global approach 
   - Spatial thinking 
   - An interdisciplinary perspective 
   - Understanding of the complexity of interactions between humans and the environment 
   - Social science research methods, policy analysis, and technical skills 
   - Written, oral and visual communication skills 
   - Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and mapping software
