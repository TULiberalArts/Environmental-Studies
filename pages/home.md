## Study the Environment and Make a Difference
The Environmental Studies program examines the nature, causes and consequences of human interactions with the environment. We equip our students with the tools to understand and address the crucial environmental issues of our time, such as climate change, food access and natural resource consumption. The Environmental Studies program is affiliated with the Department of Geography and Urban Studies — a department with a highly respected faculty invested in student success. Our faculty and administrative staff give students unmatched attention through mentorship, extracurricular and research opportunities. We offer a BA in Environmental Studies, a minor and a certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Combining strong social science skills with technical training, the Department of Geography and Urban Studies works to understand and address issues relating to

- **Globalization:** Capital and labor flows, welfare state restructuring, identity, culture and concepts of citizenship.
- **Social Justice:** Increasing inequalities in terms of economics, gender and inequalities.
- **Sustainability:** Urban ecology, environmental justice, land use and sprawled development patterns.
