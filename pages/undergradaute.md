The bachelor’s degree in environmental studies for students interested in learning about environmental processes, the geography of natural resources and geospatial technologies. We teach qualitative and quantitative social science research methods to help students understand the relationships between people and their environment. This major prepares students for graduate programs in environmental studies, law, geography, planning and other fields.

## Map Your Career

Our students land competitive, meaningful jobs upon  graduation in Philadelphia and beyond, working in business, government and non-profits sectors. The US Department of Labor projects much faster than average job growth in  environmentally related fields.

With the rise of smart technology, the 21st century is marked by a rapid increase in geospatial information. Our curriculum introduces students to current technologies that give them a competitive edge in the job market. The geospatial  technology industry alone is growing at an annual rate of  almost 35 percent and trained technicians are in  
high demand.

## Small Department. Big Opportunities.

The Environmental Studies program is affiliated with the Department of Geography and Urban Studies — a department with a highly respected faculty invested in student success. Our faculty and administrative staff give students unmatched attention through mentorship,  extracurricular and research opportunities.

## Philadelphia Is Your Classroom

While maintaining a global perspective, being an  environmental studies program in the heart of Philadelphia gives our students an excellent opportunity to take what they learn and apply it outside the classroom.

## Major in Environmental Studies

Environmental Studies is an interdisciplinary major offered by the Department of Geography and Urban Studies that examines the nature, causes and consequences of human interactions with the environment. Students in Environmental Studies gain the intellectual and methodological tools to understand and address the crucial environmental issues of our time and the impact on individuals, society, and the planet. Students in Environmental Studies are introduced to physical geography, an understanding of the economic system, and social science methods (GIS, spatial statistics, remote sensing, environmental impact assessment, quantitative and qualitative research methods) that then prepare them for the upper-level electives that students may tailor to their own academic interests.

## Minor

A minor in ES is available to any student enrolled at Temple University and many students choose to add a ES minor as a complement to their program of study. This is an 18-credit minor, requiring students to take one Gateway course and five electives. More information about the ES minor is available [here](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/environmental-studies/minor-environmental-studies/).

## Curriculum

The Environmental Studies core courses are designed to develop the theoretical and methodological frameworks and tools necessary to understand the relationships between people and their environment as they interact through local to global connections.  Students examine environmental policy and the role of political institutions; environmental decision-making; natural hazards and risk assessment; environmental ethics and legal issues; and environmental justice. The electives give students the opportunity to develop an area of emphasis around their particular interests.

The Environmental Studies major requires students to complete a total of 39 credits, including two Gateway courses, four Methods courses, one Geography of Natural Resources course, five Elective courses, and one Capstone course.

Environment Studies students will acquire an understanding in the following areas:

- Current environmental issues such as health and justice, geospatial techniques and environmental policy;
- Social science approaches to examining nature-society relations;
- Environmental principles including earth processes, global climate change, environmental hazards, and natural resource management;
- Basic economic principles through the intersection of geography of natural resource management, economics, and development; and
- Rigorous social science research on environmental issues, including qualitative and quantitative methods, policy research, Geographic - Information Systems (GIS), and spatial statistics.
