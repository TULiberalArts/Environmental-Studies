## Major in Environmental Studies
If you major in environmental studies at Temple, you will gain the intellectual and methodological tools to understand and address the crucial environmental issues of our time and the impact on individuals, society and the planet. The BA in Environmental Studies introduces students to environmental processes, the geography of natural resources, geospatial technologies and qualitative and quantitative social science research methods. Required courses in our curriculum introduce students to environmental science in a broad but comprehensive manner. Upper-level electives are tailored to your personal academic interests in the discipline.

## Minor in Environmental Studies
Regardless of your major, a minor in geography and urban studies helps you develop skills of analysis, team work, computing and critical thinking. The 18-credit minor requires one gateway course and five electives. A environmental studies minor helps you stand out when you apply for jobs or graduate school, because it shows that you have a well-rounded education.

## Undergraduate Certificate in GIS
GIS is anything that combines data and maps. Because it is so widely applicable, GIS is a linchpin of the information age. Geospatial technology is considered a high-growth industry by the U.S. Department of Labor and employers seek candidates trained in geospatial technologies. A GIS certificate will give you the skills  to take on advanced research positions in technology-based companies, governmental agencies and non-profit organizations. The GIS certificate is open to students across all colleges and schools at Temple University.
