## Major in Environmental Studies
Environmental Studies is an interdisciplinary major offered by the Department of Geography and Urban Studies. Environmental Studies examines the nature, causes and consequences of human interactions with the environment. Students in Environmental Studies seek to understand and address the crucial environmental issues of our time, such as climate change, environmental justice, and resource management. Our students are introduced to physical geography, an understanding of the economic system, and social science methods (GIS, spatial statistics, remote sensing, environmental impact assessment, quantitative and qualitative research methods) and are given flexibility to choose electives that fit the students’ own academic interests.

This major prepares students for environmentally-focused careers as well as graduate programs in environmental studies, law, geography, resource management, planning and other fields. This certificate is open to students in all majors across all colleges and schools at Temple University.

Environment Studies student are introduced to:
- Current environmental issues such as health and justice, geospatial techniques and environmental policy

## Undergraduate Certificate in GIS
GIS is powerful analytical software that combines data with maps. It allows users to query, analyze and visualize spatial data, asking any “where” questions, such as “where are we seeing outbreaks of flu,” “where will this utility have the greatest impact” or “where should we open our storefront?”  Because it is so widely applicable, geographic information has become one of the linchpins of the Information Age. Employers across industries are seeking candidates trained in geospatial technologies. Because its uses are so pervasive, geospatial technology is considered a high-growth industry by the U.S. Department of Labor, growing at an annual rate of almost 35 percent, with faster than average job growth expected over the next 10 years.
